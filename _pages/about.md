I’m a psychologist studying early neural and cognitive development, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem as it plays out in social contexts. My research explores how social cognition is intertwined with the physical states of the brain and body. I earned my PhD in 2021 from the University of British Columbia, where I worked with Kiley Hamlin to study the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying infants’ responses to social interactions. I then completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Nathan Fox at the University of Maryland, investigating the roots of social anxiety and the links between early brain activity and cognitive development.

I’m now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia, working with Hee Yeon Im. My current work uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) and machine learning to explore how social information is represented in the brains of both infants and adults. In January 2026, I will be joining the Department of Psychology at the University of Victoria as an Assistant Professor.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, biking/rollerblading, listening to music, and dancing Lindy Hop.
