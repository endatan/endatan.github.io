I’m a psychologist studying early neural and cognitive development, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem as it plays out in social contexts. My research explores how social cognition is intertwined with the physical states of the brain and body. I earned my PhD in 2021 from the University of British Columbia, where I worked with [Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/) to study the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying infants’ responses to social interactions. I then completed a postdoctoral fellowship with [Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan) at the University of Maryland, investigating the roots of social anxiety and the links between early brain activity and cognitive development.

I’m now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia, working with [Hee Yeon Im](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/hee-yeon-im/). My current work uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) and machine learning to explore how social information is represented in the brains of both infants and adults. In January 2026, I will be joining the Department of Psychology at the University of Victoria as an Assistant Professor.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, biking, listening to music, and dancing Lindy Hop.
